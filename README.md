## Install


```bash
$ npm install
// You need to set API_KEY of TOP News API and Search API  in the .env file 
// You need to set IP Address in DEV_URL.js file to connect App to local backend
// Your Laptop and Mobile Real Device should be connected to the same internet server
// Credentials For Login
// username farooq@gmail.com
// password 123
// for ios
cd ios
pod install
$ npm run ios
// for android
$ npm run ios
```

There is a bug in backend 
if you register a new user and you enter in App and then you gets Logged out and wants to Login Again then you need to run backend local server again 
then you can get logged in 
otherwise it doesn't authenticate

Might need to run
```
npm audit fix
```
